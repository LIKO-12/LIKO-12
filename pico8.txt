 (c) Copyright 2014-2016 Lexaloffle Games LLP
 Author: Joseph White // hey@lexaloffle.com
 
 PICO-8 is built with:

 	Lua 5.2 http://www.lua.org  // see license.txt
 	GIFLIB http://giflib.sourceforge.net/
 	WiringPi http://wiringpi.com/

============================================================================================

Welcome to PICO-8!

	PICO-8 is a fantasy console for making, sharing and playing tiny games and other computer 
	programs. When you turn it on, the machine greets you with a shell for typing in Lua programs 
	straight away and provides simple built-in tools for creating sprites, maps and sound.

	The harsh limitations of PICO-8 are carefully chosen to be fun to work with, encourage small
	but expressive designs and hopefully to give PICO-8 cartridges their own particular look and 
	feel.


:: Keys

	Toggle Fullscreen: Alt+Enter 
	Quit: Alt+F4 or command-Q
	Reload/Run/Restart cart: Ctrl+R
	Quick-Save: Ctrl+S
	Mute/Unmute: Ctrl+M
	Player 1 defaults: Cursors + ZX / NM / CV
	Player 2 defaults: SDFE + tab,Q / shift A
	Enter for pause menu (while running)
	// use KEYCONFIG to change the defaults.
	

:: Specs

	Display: 128x128, fixed 16 colour palette
	Input: 6 buttons
	Cartridge size: 32k
	Sound: 4 channel, 64 definable chip blerps
	Code: Lua (max 8192 tokens of code) 
	Sprites: Single bank of 128 8x8 sprites (+128 shared)
	Map: 128x32 8-bit cels (+128x32 shared)

	
:: Hello World

	After PICO-8 boots, try typing some of these commands followed by enter:

		PRINT("HELLO WORLD")
		RECTFILL(80,80,120,100,12)
		CIRCFILL(70,90,20,14)
		FOR I=1,4 DO PRINT(I) END
	
	(Note: PICO-8 only displays upper-case characters -- just type normally without capslock!)
	
	You can build up an interactive program by using commands like this in the code editing
	mode along with two special callback function _update and _draw. For example, the following
	program allows you to move a circle around with the cursor keys. Press escape to switch
	to the code editor and type or copy & paste the following code:

	X = 64  Y = 64
	FUNCTION _UPDATE()
	 IF (BTN(0)) THEN X=X-1 END
	 IF (BTN(1)) THEN X=X+1 END
	 IF (BTN(2)) THEN Y=Y-1 END
	 IF (BTN(3)) THEN Y=Y+1 END
	END

	FUNCTION _DRAW()
	 RECTFILL(0,0,127,127,5)
	 CIRCFILL(X,Y,7,8)
	END

	Now press escape to return to the main console and type RUN to see it in action.
	See the example cartridges for more complex programs.


:: Example Cartridges

	These cartridges are included with PICO-8 and can be installed by typing:
	INSTALL_DEMOS
	CD DEMOS
	
	API        Demonstrates most PICO-8 functions
	JELPI      Platform game demo w/ 2p support 
	CAST       2.5D Raycaster demo
	MANDEL     Mandelbrot explorer
	COLLIDE    Example wall and actor collisions
	BUTTERFLY  Serpinsky triangles thing
	DRIPPY     Draw a drippy squiggle
	STOMPY     Music cart
	WOO        Music cart

	To run a cartridge, open PICO-8 and type:

	LOAD JELPI
	RUN
	
	Press escape to stop the program, and once more to enter editing mode.


:: Filesystem

	These commands can be used to manage files and directories (folders):
	
	DIR        list the current directory
	CD BLAH    change directory
	CD ..      go up a directory
	CD /       change back to top directory (on pico-8's virtual drive)
	MKDIR      make a directory
	FOLDER     open the current directory in the host operating system's file browser

	LOAD BLAH  load a cart from the current directory
	SAVE BLAH  save a cart to the current directory

	If you want to move files around, duplicate them or delete them, best use the 
	FOLDER command and do it in the host operating system.
	
	The default location for PICO-8's drive is:
	
	Windows: C:/Users/Yourname/AppData/Roaming/pico-8/carts
	OSX: /Users/Yourname/Library/Application Support/pico-8/carts
	Linux: ~/.lexaloffle/pico-8/carts

	You can change this and other settings in pico-8/config.txt
	
	Tip: if you are a Dropbox user, it's possible to set the drive directory to be a
	shared dropbox folder in order to provide a single disk for PICO-8 machines spread
	across different host machines.


:: Backups

	If you quit without saving changes, or overwrite an existing file, a backup of the 
	cartridge is saved to pico-8/backup.
	

:: Configuration

	:: config.txt
	
		You can find some settings in config.txt. Edit the file when PICO-8 is not running.
	
		Windows: C:/Users/Yourname/AppData/Roaming/pico-8/config.txt
		OSX: /Users/Yourname/Library/Application Support/pico-8/config.txt
		Linux: ~/.lexaloffle/pico-8/config.txt

		Use the -home switch (below) to use a different path to store config.txt and other data.
		

	:: Commandline parameters
	
		// note: these override settings found in config.txt
	
		pico-8 [switches] [filename.p8]
	
		-run                 boot filename.p8 on startup
		-width n             set the window width 
		-height n            set the window height 
		-windowed n          set windowed mode off (0) or on (1)
		-sound n             sound volume 0..256
		-music n             sound volume 0..256
		-joystick n          joystick controls starts at player n (0..7)
		-pixel_perfect n     1 for unfiltered screen stretching at integer scales (on by default)
		-draw_rect x,y,w,h   absolute window coordinates and size to draw pico-8's screen 
		-run filename        automatically load and run a cartridge
		-splore              boot in splore mode
		-home path           set the path to store config.txt and other user data files
		-desktop path        set a location for screenshots and gifs to be saved
		-screenshot_scale n  scale of screenshots.  default: 3 (368x368 pixels)
		-gif_scale n         scale of gif captures. default: 2 (256x256 pixels)
		-gif_len n           set the maximum gif length in seconds (1..120)
		-gui_theme n         use 1 for a higher contrast editor colour scheme
		-timeout n           how many seconds to wait before downloads timeout (default: 30)


	:: Controller Setup
	
		PICO-8 uses the SDL2 controller configuration scheme. It will detect common controllers
		on startup and also looks for custom mappings in sdl_controllers.txt in the same directory 
		as config.txt. sdl_controllers.txt has one mapping per line.
	
		To generate a custom mapping string for your controller, use either the controllermap
		program that comes with SDL2, or try http://www.generalarcade.com/gamepadtool/
	
		To set up which keyboard keys trigger joystick buttons presses, use KEYCONFIG.


:: Sharing Cartridges / HTML5 Exporter

	There are three ways to share carts:
	
		1. Share the .p8 or .p8.png file directly with other PICO-8 users
	
		2. Post the cart on the Lexaloffe BBS to get a web-playable version

			http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php?page=submit

		See save() for notes on how to generate .p8.png versions. (search for .png)

		3. Export the cartridge to a stand-alone html5 version:
		
			EXPORT FOO.HTML
			
			This will generate two files: foo.html and foo.js (you need both!)
			
			You are free to distribute and use exported cartridges as you please, provided 
			that you have permission from the author and contributors.
			
			The .html file is intended as a template that can be modified as needed.
			It includes some buttons to control settings and a link to an external website
			(PICO-8 BBS cartridges by default), along with javascript to block keypresses
			in order to prevent web page scrolling while the cartridge is played.
			
			Note that the width and height of the player can be configured, but should
			normally match the size of the canvas it is displayed on (580,540 by default).


:: Screenshots, Videos and Cartridge Labels

	While a cartridge is running use:

		F6 Save a screenshot to desktop
		F7 Capture cartridge label image
		F8 Start recording a video
		F9 Save GIF video to desktop (max: 8 seconds by default)
		
		// if F6..F9 are not available on your system, use F1..F4
	
	Cartridge label is saved when using save() with p8.png format.
	
	You can save a video at any time (it is always recording) -- use F8 just to reset
	the video starting point if you want something less than 8 seconds long.

	To change the maximum gif length, edit gif_len in config.txt to specify the number
	of seconds to record for. The gif format can not match 30fps exactly, so PICO-8 
	instead uses the closest match: 33.3fps.
	

:: Exporters / Importers

	1. To import or export the spritesheet as a .png:
	
		import("blah.png")    --  expects 128x128 png and colour-fits to the pico-8 palette
		export("blah.png")    --  use folder() to locate the exported png
	
	2. To export sound effects or music:
	
		export("blah.wav")    --  export music from the current pattern (when editor mode is MUSIC)
		export("blah.wav")    --  export the current SFX (when editor mode is SFX)
		export("blah%d.wav")  --  exports all of the SFXs as blah0.wav, blah1.wav .. blah63.wav

		// From commandline, you can skip the brackets and quotes: EXPORT BLAH.WAV 


:: Quirks of PICO-8

	Common gotchas to watch out for:
	
	- The bottom half of the spritesheet and bottom half of the map occupy the same memory.
		// Best use only one or the other if you're unsure how this works.
	- PICO-8 numbers only go up to 32767.99.
		// If you add 1 to a counter each frame, it will overflow after around 18 minutes!
	- Lua arrays are 1-based by default, not 0-based. FOREACH starts at T[1], not T[0].
	- cos() and sin() take 0..1 instead of 0..PI*2, and sin() is inverted.
	- sgn(0) returns 1.
	- Toggle fullscreen: use alt-enter on OSX (command-F is used for searching text).
	- When you want to export a .png cartridge, use SAVE, not EXPORT. EXPORT will save only the spritesheet!


:: Splore

	SPLORE is a built-in utility for browsing and organising both local and bbs (online)
	cartridges. Type SPLORE [enter] to launch it, or launch PICO-8 with -splore. 
	
	It is possible to control SPLORE entirely with a joystick:
	LEFT and RIGHT to navigate lists of cartridges
	UP AND DOWN to select items in each list
	X,O or MENU to launch the cartridge
	
	While inside a cart, press MENU to favourite a cartridge or exit to splore.
	If you're using a keyboard, it's also possible to press F to favourite an item
	while it is selected in the cartridge list view.
	
	When viewing a list of BBS carts, use the top list item to re-download a list of
	cartridges. If you are offline, the last downloaded list is displayed, and it is
	still possible to play any cartridges you have downloaded.
	
	If you have installed PICO-8 on a machine with no internet access, you can also
	use INSTALL_GAMES to add a small selection of pre-installed BBS carts to your
	favourites list.
	

============================================================================================
	Editor Modes
============================================================================================
	
	Press escape to toggle between console and editor
	Click editing mode tabs at top right to switch or press ALT+LEFT/RIGHT


	** WARNING: The second half of the sprite sheet (banks 2 and 3), and the bottom half
	of the map share the same cartridge space. It's up to you how you use the data, but
	be aware that drawing on the second half of the sprite sheet could clobber data on
	the map and vice versa.
	

:: Code Editor
	
	Hold shift to select (or click and drag with mouse)
	CTRL-X, C, V to cut copy or paste selected
	CTRL-Z, Y to undo, redo
	CTRL-F to search for text
	CTRL-G to repeat the last search again
	CTRL-UP, DOWN to jump to start or end of the program
	ALT-UP, DOWN to navigate to the previous, next function
	
	At the bottom right of the code editor you can see how many tokens have been used. One 
	program can have a maximum of 8192 tokens. Each token is a word (e.g. variable name) or 
	operator. Pairs of brackets, and strings count as 1 token. commas, periods, LOCALs, semi-
	colons, ENDs, and comments are not counted.
	
	To enter special characters that represent buttons, use SHIFT-L,R,U,D,O,X
	

:: Sprite Editor

	The sprite editor is designed to be used both for sprite-wise editing and for freeform 
	pixel-level editing. The sprite navigator at the bottom of the screen provides an 8x8-wise 
	view into the sprite-sheet, but it is possible to use freeform tools (pan, select) when
	dealing with larger or oddly sized areas.

	Draw Tool
		Click and drag on the sprite to edit
		Applies to visible area
		Hold CTRL to search and replace a colour
		Use left moust button to select colour

	Stamp Tool
		Click to stamp whatever is in the 
		Hold LCONTROL to stamp with transparency

	Select Tool // shortcut: LSHIFT or S
		Create a selection
		Enter or click to select none.
		
		If a pixel-wise selection is not present, many operations are instead applied
		to a sprite-wise selection. To select sprites, shift-drag in the sprite navigator.
	
	Pan Tool // shortcut: space
		View the spritesheet.
	
	Fill Tool
		Fill with the current colour
		Applies to the current selection
		If no selection, applies to visible area

	Extra keys
		CTRL-Z to undo // single step only in 0.2.0
		CTRL-C to copy selected area or selected sprites
		CTRL-V to paste to current sprite location
		Q,W to switch to previous/next sprite
		1,2 to switch to previous/next colour
		Tab to toggle fullscreen view
		Mousewheel to zoom (centered in fullscreen)
	
	
	Operations on selected area or selected sprites:
		f to flip
		v to flip vertically
		r to rotate (must be square selection)
		Cursor keys to move (loops if sprite selection)
		
	Sprite flags
		The 8 coloured circles are sprite flags for the current sprite.
		Each one can be true (on) or false (off), and are accessed by
		using the FSET and FGET functions. They are indexed from 0, from
		the left (0,1,2..7). See fset() for more information.
	

:: Map Editor

	The pico-8 map is a 128x32 (or 128x64 using shared space) block of 8-bit values.
	Each value is shown in the editor as a reference to a sprite (0..255), but you can
	of course use the data to represent whatever you like.

	The tools are similar to the ones used in sprite editing mode. Select a sprite
	and click and drag to paint values into the map.	

	To draw multiple sprites, select from sprite navigator with shift+drag
	To copy a block of values, use the selection tool and then stamp tool to paste
	To pan around the map, use the pan tool or hold space
	Q,W to switch to previous/next sprite



:: Sfx Editor

	There are 64 SFX ("sound effects") in a cartridge, used for both sound and music.
	
	Each SFX has 32 notes, and each note has:
		A frequency   (C0..C5)
		An instrument (0..7)
		A volume      (0..7)
		An effect     (0..7)
	
	Each SFX also has these properties:
	
		A play speed (SPD) : the number of 'ticks' to play each note for.
			// This means that 1 is fastest, 3 is 3x as slow, etc.
		
		Loop start and end : this is the note index to loop back and to
			// Looping is turned off when the start index >= end index
	
	There are 2 modes for editing/viewing a SFX: Pitch mode (more suitable
	for sound effects) and tracker mode (more suitable for music). The mode
	can be changed using the top-left buttons, or toggled with TAB.
	
	
	1. Pitch Mode
	
		Click and drag on the pitch area to set the frequency for each note,
		using the currently selected instrument (indicated by colour).
		
		Hold shift to apply only the selected instrument
		Hold CTRL to snap notes to the C minor pentatonic scale
	
	
	2. Tracker Mode
	
		Each note shows: frequency octave instrument volume effect
		To enter a note, use q2w3er5t6y7ui zsxdcvgbhnjm (piano-like layout)
		New notes are given the selected instrument/effect values
		To delete a note, press backspace or set the volume to 0
	
		Click and then shift-click to select a range that can be copied
		(CTRL-C) and pasted (CTRL-V)
		
		
	3. Controls for both modes
	
		- + to navigate the current SFX
	    < > to change the speed.
		SPACE to play/stop
		A to release a looping sample
		Click or left click to increase / decrease the SPD or LOOP values
		 // Hold shift when clicking to increase / decrease by 4
		 // Alternatively, click and drag left/right or up/down
		Shift-click an instrument, effect, or volume to apply to all notes.
	
	
	:: Effects
	
		0 none
		1 slide          //  Slide to the next note
		2 vibrato        //  Rapidly vary the pitch within one quarter-tone
		3 drop           //  Rapidly drop the frequency to very low values
		4 fade in        //  Ramp the volume up from 0
		5 fade out       //  Ramp the volume down to 0
		6 arpeggio fast  //  Iterate over groups of 4 notes at speed of 4
		7 arpeggio slow  //  Iterate over groups of 4 notes at speed of 8
		
		If the SFX speed is <= 8, arpeggio speeds are halved to 2, 4


:: Music Editor

	Music in PICO-8 is controlled by a sequence of 'patterns'. Each pattern is a list of
	4 numbers indicating which SFX will be played on that channel.
	
	
	:: Flow control
	
		Playback flow can be controlled using the 3 buttons at the top right.
	
		When a pattern has finished playing, the next pattern is played unless:
	
		- there is no data left to play (music stops)
		- a STOP command is set on that pattern (the first button)
		- a LOOP BACK command is set (the 3rd button), in which case the music player searches
			back for a pattern with the LOOP START command set (the 2nd button) or returns to
			pattern 0 if none is found.
	
		When a pattern has SFXes with different speeds, the pattern finishes playing when
		the left-most non-looping channel has finished playing. This can be used to set up
		irregular time signatures, or double-time drum beats etc.
	
	
	:: Copying music between or within cartridges
	
		To select a range of patterns: click once on the first pattern in the pattern 
		navigator, then shift-click on the last pattern. Selected patterns can be copied 
		and pasted with CTRL-C and CTRL-V. When pasting into another cartridge, the SFX 
		that each pattern points to will also be pasted (possibly with a different index) 
		if it does not already exist.

	
============================================================================================
	Lua Syntax Primer
============================================================================================

PICO-8 programs are written using Lua syntax, but do not use the standard Lua library.
The following is a brief summary of essential Lua syntax.

For more details, or to find out about proper Lua, see www.lua.org.

:: Comments

	-- use two hyphens like this to ignore everything until the end of the line
	--[[ multi-line
	comments ]]
	
	
:: Types and assignment

	Types in Lua are numbers, strings, booleans and tables;

	NUM = 12/100
	S = "THIS IS A STRING"
	B = FALSE
	T = {1,2,3}
	
	Numbers in PICO-8 are all 16:16 fixed point. They range from -32768.0 to 32767.99
	
	Hexedecimal notation with optional fractional parts can be used:
		0x11        -- 17
		0x11.4000   -- 17.25
	
	Dividing by zero evaluates as the largest possible number: 0x7fff.ffff
	

:: Conditionals

	IF NOT B THEN
		PRINT("B IS FALSE")
	ELSE
		PRINT("B IS NOT FALSE")
	END
	
	-- with ELSEIF
	
	IF X == 0 THEN
		PRINT("X IS 0")
	ELSEIF X < 0 THEN
		PRINT("X IS NEGATIVE")
	ELSEIF X > 0 THEN
		PRINT("X IS POSITIVE")
	ELSE
		PRINT("THIS IS LINE IS NEVER REACHED")
	END
	
	IF (4 == 4) THEN PRINT("EQUAL") END
	IF (4 ~= 3) THEN PRINT("NOT EQUAL") END
	IF (4 <= 4) THEN PRINT("LESS THAN OR EQUAL") END
	IF (4 > 3) THEN PRINT("MORE THAN") END

:: Loops

	FOR X=1,5 DO
		PRINT(X)
	END
	-- prints 1,2,3,4,5

	X = 1
	WHILE(X <= 5) DO
		PRINT(X)
		X = X + 1
	END
	
	FOR X=1,10,3 DO PRINT(X) END   -- 1,4,7,10

	FOR X=5,1,-2 DO PRINT(X) END  -- 5,3,1
	

:: Functions and Local Variables

	Y=0 
	FUNCTION PLUSONE(X)
		LOCAL Y = X+1
		RETURN Y
	END
	PRINT(PLUSONE(2)) -- 3
	PRINT(Y)          -- 0


:: Tables
	
	In Lua, tables are a collection of key-value pairs where the key and value types can both 
	be mixed. They can be used as arrays by indexing them with integers.

	A={} -- create an empty table
	A[1] = "BLAH"
	A[2] = 42
	A["FOO"] = {1,2,3}

	-- Arrays use 1-based indexing by default
	
	A = {11,12,13,14}
	PRINT(A[2]) -- 12
	
	-- The size of a table indexed with sequential 1-based integers:
	
	PRINT(#A)   -- 4
	
	-- Indexes that are strings can be written using dot notation
	
	PLAYER = {}
	PLAYER.X = 2 -- is equivalent to PLAYER["X"]
	PLAYER.Y = 3

	-- see also the tables section in the api reference below.

	
:: PICO-8 Shorthand

	PICO-8 also allows several non-standard, shorter ways to write common patterns.
	
	1. IF THEN END statements on a single line can be expressed without the THEN & END
	
	IF (NOT B) I=1 J=2
	
	-- is equivalent to: IF (NOT B) THEN I=1 J=2 END
	-- note that the condition must be surrounded by brackets.
	
	
	2. unary math operators
	
	a += 2  -- equivalent to: a = a + 2
	a -= 2  -- equivalent to: a = a - 2
	a *= 2  -- equivalent to: a = a * 2
	a /= 2  -- equivalent to: a = a / 2
	a %= 2  -- equivalent to: a = a % 2
	
	
	3. != operator
	
	Not shorthand, but pico-8 also accepts != instead of ~= for "not equal to"


============================================================================================
	API
============================================================================================

	PICO-8 is built on the Lua scripting language, but does not include the Lua standard library.
	Instead, a small api is offered in keeping with PICO-8's minimal design and limited screen
	space. For an example program that uses most of the api functions, see /DEMOS/API.P8 
	
	Functions are written here as:
	function_name parameter [optional_parameter]

	System functions called from commandline can omit the usual brackets and string quotes:
	load blah.p8 --> load("blah.p8")

	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	System
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


load filename
save filename
	Load or save a cartridge
	
	Use ".png" format to save a png -- otherwise text format (".p8") is used.
	
	The ".p8" can be omitted in both cases, and it is automatically added
		save("blah") --> save("blah.p8")
		save("blah.png") --> save("blah.p8.png")
		load("blah.png") --> load("blah.p8.png") (if blah.png doesn't exist)
	
	Same goes for loading. If the file is not found, pico-8 will try again with ".p8" inserted.
	
	The ".png" can also be omitted, but only when loading
		load ("blah") --> tries "blah.p8.png" and then "blah.png" if "blah.p8" doesn't exist
	
	Once a cartridge has been loaded or saved, it can also be quick-saved with CTRL-S

	Use a filename of "@clip" to load or save to the host's clipboard.

	:: Saving .png carts with a text label and preview image
	
	To generate a preview image saved with the cart, run the program first and press F7 to grab
	whatever is on the screen. The first two lines of the program starting with '--' are also drawn 
	to the cart's label.

	e.g.
	-- OCEAN DIVER LEGENDS
	-- BY LOOPY
	
	
	:: Code size restrictions for .png format
	
	When saving in .png format, the compressed size of the code must be less than 15360 bytes. To find 
	out the current size of your code, use the INFO command. The compressed size limit is not enforced
	for .p8 format. In most cases you don't need to worry about the compressed size, as the token 
	limit (8192) will be reached first.


folder
	Open the carts folder in the host operating system.

ls
	List all files in the current folder

run
	Run from the start of the program
	Can be called from inside a program to reset program.

resume
	Run from the existing cart state (flakey)

reboot
	Reboot the machine
	Useful for starting a new project

stat x
	x:0 returns current Lua memory useage (0..1024MB)
	x:1 returns cpu useage for last frame (1.0 means 100% at 30fps)

info
	Print out some information about the cartridge:
	code size, tokens, compressed size
	
flip
	Flip the back buffer to screen and wait for next frame (30fps)
	Don't normally need to do this -- _draw() calls it for you.
	
	If your program does not call flip before a frame is up, and a _draw() callback
	is not in progress, the current contents of the back buffer are copied to screen.

printh str [filename] [overwrite]
	Print a string to host operating system's console for debugging.
	
	If filename is set, append the string to a file on the host operating system
		// (in the current directory -- use FOLDER to view)
	Setting overwrite to true causes that file to be overwritten rather than appended.
	Use a filename of "@clip" to write to the host's clipboard.
		// use stat(4) to read the clipboard, but the contents of the clipboard are only
		// available after user presses CTRL-V during runtime (for security reasons).


stat x

	Get system status where x is:
	
	0 Memory useage
	1 CPU used since last flip (1.0 == 100% CPU)
	4 Clipboard contents (after user has pressed CTRL-V)
	
	16..19 Index of currently playing SFX on channels 0..3
	20..23 Note number (0..31) on channel 0..3


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Program Structure
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	There are 3 special functions that, if defined by the user, are called during program 
	execution:
	
		_update()
			Called once per update at 30fps
	
		_draw()
			Called once per visible frame
		
		_init()
			Called once on program startup


	_draw() is normally called at 30fps, but if it can not complete in time, pico-8 will
	attempt to run at 15ps and call _update() twice per visible frame to compensate.
	
	
	
	:: Running PICO-8 at 60fps

		If _update60() is defined instead of _update(), PICO-8 will run in 60fps mode:
	
			- both _update60() and _draw() are called at 60fps
			- half the PICO-8 CPU is available per frame before dropping down to 30fps

		** please note that not all PICO-8s support 60fps. On machines that do not support it,
		_update60() will instead be called twice per frame and _draw() at 30fps. You can check 
		the behaviour of your program running at 30fps by adding the following snippet to the 
		bottom of your code:
	
		u60=_update60 _update60=nil function _update() u60() u60() end


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Graphics
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	PICO-8 has a single bank of 128 8x8 sprites, plus another 128 that overlaps with the
	bottom half of the map data ("shared data"). These 256 sprites are collectively called
	the sprite sheet, and can be thought of as a 128x128 pixel image.

	All of PICO-8's drawing operations are subject to the current draw-state. The draw-state
	includes a camera position (for adding an offset to all coordinates), palette mapping 
	(for recolouring sprites), clipping rectangle, and a draw colour that can optionally be 
	set by any relevant function but otherwise persists.

	The draw state is reset each time a program is run. This is equivalent to calling:
	clip() camera() pal() color()

	Colours indexes:
	
	 0  black   1  dark_blue   2  dark_purple   3  dark_green  
	 4  brown   5  dark_gray   6  light_gray    7  white
	 8  red     9  orange     10  yellow       11  green       
	12  blue   13  indigo     14  pink         15  peach


clip [x y w h]

	Sets the screen's clipping region in pixels
	clip() to reset
	
	
pget x y
pset x y [c]

	Get or set the colour (c) of a pixel at x, y.
	
	
sget x y
sset x y [c]

	Get or set the colour (c) of a spritesheet pixel.
	
	
fget n [f]
fset n [f] v

	Get or set the value (v) of a sprite's flag
	f is the flag index 0..7
	v is boolean and can be true or false
	
	The initial state of flags 0..7 are settable in the sprite editor,
	using the line of little colourful buttons.
	
	The meaning of sprite flags is up to the user, or can be used to
	indicate which group ('layer') of sprites should be drawn by map.

	If the flag index is omitted, all flags are retrieved/set as a bitfield
	fset(2, 1+2+8)   -- sets bits 0,1 and 3
	fset(2, 4, true) -- sets bit 4
	print(fget(2))   -- 27 (1+2+8+16)


print str [x y [col]]

	Print a string
	If only str is supplied, and the cursor reaches the end of the screen,
	a carriage return and vertical scroll is automatically applied.
	(terminal-like behaviour)


cursor x y

	Set the cursor position and carriage return margin


color col

	Set the default color to be used by drawing functions
	
	
cls

	Clear the screen


camera [x y]

	Set a screen offset of -x, -y for all drawing operations
	camera() to reset
	
	
circ     x y r [col]
circfill x y r [col]

	Draw a circle or filled circle at x,y with radius r


line x0 y0 x1 y1 [col]

	draw line


rect     x0 y0 x1 y1 [col]
rectfill x0 y0 x1 y1 [col]

	Draw a rectange or filled rectange
	

pal c0 c1 [p]

	Draw all instances of colour c0 as c1 in subsequent draw calls

	pal() to reset to system defaults (including transparency values)
	Two types of palette (p; defaults to 0)
		0 draw palette   : colours are remapped on draw    // e.g. to re-colour sprites
		1 screen palette : colours are remapped on display // e.g. for fades
	c0 colour index 0..15
	c1 colour index to map to
	

palt c t

	Set transparency for colour index to t (boolean)
	Transparency is observed by spr(), sspr() and map()
	e.g. palt(8, true) -- red pixels not drawn
	palt() resets to default: all colours opaque except colour 0
	


spr n x y [w h] [flip_x] [flip_y]

	draw sprite n (0..255) at position x,y
	width and height are 1,1 by default and specify how many sprites wide to blit.
	Colour 0 drawn as transparent by default (see palt())
	flip_x=true to flip horizontally
	flip_y=true to flip vertically


sspr sx sy sw sh dx dy [dw dh] [flip_x] [flip_y]

	Stretch rectangle from sprite sheet (sx, sy, sw, sh) // given in pixels
	and draw in rectangle (dx, dy, dw, dh)
	Colour 0 drawn as transparent by default (see palt())
	dw, dh defaults to sw, sh
	flip_x=true to flip horizontally
	flip_y=true to flip vertically


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Tables
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
add t v

	Add value v to the end of table t.
	Equivalent to t[#t+1] = v

		FOO={}        -- create empty table
		ADD(FOO, 11)
		ADD(FOO, 22)
		PRINT(FOO[2]) -- 22

del t v

	Delete the first instance of value v in table t
	The remaining entries are shifted left one index to avoid holes.
	Note that v is the value of the item to be deleted, not the index into the table!
	del() can be called safely on a table's item while iterating over that table.

		A={1,10,2,11,3,12}
		FOR ITEM IN ALL(A) DO
			IF (ITEM < 10) THEN DEL(A, ITEM) END
		END
		FOREACH(A, PRINT) -- 10,11,12
		PRINT(A[3])       -- 12


all t

	Used in FOR loops to iterate over all items in a table (that have a 1-based integer index), 
	in the order they were added.
	
		T = {11,12,13};
		ADD(T,14)
		ADD(T,"HI")
		FOR V IN ALL(T) DO PRINT(V) END -- 11 12 13 14 HI
		PRINT(#T) -- 5


foreach t f

	For each item in table t, call function f with the item as a single parameter.
	
		FOREACH(T, PRINT)


pairs t

	Used in FOR loops to iterate over table t, providing both the key and value for each item.
	Unlike all(), pairs() iterates over every item regardless of indexing scheme.
	Order is not guaranteed.
	
		T = {["HELLO"]=3, [10]="BLAH"}
		T.BLUE = 5;
		FOR K,V IN PAIRS(T) DO
			PRINT("K: "..K.."  V:"..V)
		END

	Output:
		
		K: 10  v:BLAH
		K: HELLO  v:3
		K: BLUE  v:5


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Input
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

btn [i [p]]

	get button i state for player p (default 0)
	i: 0..5: left right up down button_o button_x
	p: player index 0..7
	
	If no parameters supplied, returns a bitfield of all 12 button states for player 0 & 1
		// P0: bits 0..5  P1: bits 8..13
	
	Default keyboard mappings to player buttons:
		player 0: cursors, Z,X / C,V / N,M
		player 1: ESDF, LSHIFT,A / TAB,Q,E


btnp [i [p]]

	Same as btn() but only true when the button was not pressed the last frame
	btnp() also returns true every 4 frames after the button is held for 15 frames.
	
	Useful for things like 'press a button to continue' or menu item movement.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Audio
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

sfx n [channel [offset]]

	play sfx n on channel (0..3) from note offset (0..31)
	n -1 to stop sound on that channel
	n -2 to release sound on that channel from looping
	any music playing on the channel will be halted
	offset in notes (0..31)
	
	channel -1 (default) to automatically choose a channel that is not being used
		// if nothing plays, check you gave music() a channel_mask so that music
		// playback doesn't hog all channels. (e.g. 1+2 for the first two channels) 


music [n [fade_len [channel_mask]]]

	play music starting from pattern n (0..63)
	n -1 to stop music
	fade_len in ms (default: 0)
	channel_mask specifies which channels to reserve for music only
		e.g. to play on channels 0..2: 1+2+4 = 7
		
	Reserved channels can still be used to play sound effects on, but only when that
	channel index is explicitly requested by sfx().


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Map
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

mget x y
mset x y v

	get or set map value (v) at x,y

map cel_x cel_y sx sy cel_w cel_h [layer]

	draw section of map (in cels) at screen position sx, sy (pixels)
	if layer is specified, only cels with the same flag number set are drawn
		// Bitfield. So 0x5 means draw sprites with bit 0 and bit 2 set.
		// defaults to all sprites
	
	exception: sprite 0 is always taken to mean empty.
	
	e.g. map(0,0, 20,20, 4,2)
	-> draws a 4x2 blocks of cels starting from 0,0 in the map, to the screen at 20,20
	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Memory
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PICO-8 has 3 types of memory:

	1. base ram (32k): see layout below. Access with peek() poke() memcpy() memset()
	2. cart rom: same layout as base ram until 0x4300. Copy from cart to base ram with reload()
	3. lua ram (1MB): compiled program + variables. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.

	Technical note: // you probably don't need to know this
	While using the editor, the data being modified is in cart rom, but api functions such as spr() 
	and sfx() only operate on base ram. PICO-8 automatically copies cart rom to base ram (i.e.
	calls reload()) in 3 cases:

		1. When a cartridge is loaded (from 0.1.6)
		2. When a cartridge is run
		3. When exiting any of the editor modes


:: Base ram memory layout
	0x0    gfx
	0x1000 gfx2/map2 (shared)
	0x2000 map
	0x3000 gfx_props
	0x3100 song
	0x3200 sfx
	0x4300 user data
	0x5e00 persistent cart data (256 bytes)
	0x5f00 draw state
	0x5f40 hardware state
	0x5f80 gpio pins (128 bytes)
	0x6000 screen (8k)

	User data has no particular meaning and can be used for anything via memcpy(), peek() & poke().
	Persistent cart data is mapped to 0x5e00..0x5eff but only stored if cartdata() has been called.
	Colour format (gfx/screen) is 2 pixels per byte: low bits encode the left pixel of each pair.
	Map format is one byte per cel, where the byte normally encodes a sprite index.


peek addr
poke addr val

	Read and write one byte to an address in base ram.
	Legal addresses are 0x0..0x7fff
	Reading or writing outside causes a fault

memcpy dest_addr source_addr len

	Copy len bytes of base ram from source to dest
	Sections can be overlapping

reload dest_addr source_addr len [filename]

	Same as memcpy, but copies from cart rom
	The code section ( >= 0x4300) is protected and can not be read.
	If filename specified, load data from a different cartridge

cstore dest_addr source_addr len [filename]

	Same as memcpy, but copies from base ram to cart rom
	cstore() is equivalent to cstore(0, 0, 0x4300)
	Can use for writing tools to construct carts or to visualize the state 
	of the map / spritesheet using the map editor / gfx editor.
	The code section ( >= 0x4300) is protected and can not be written to.
	
	If a filename is specified, the data is written directly to that
	cartridge on disk. Up to 64 cartridges can be written in one session.
	See the 'Cartridge Data' section for additional notes on using cstore.
	
	
memset dest_addr val len

	Set len bytes to val
	(quite fast -- can use to draw unclipped horizonal scanlines etc)
	

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Math
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

max x y
min x y
mid x y z

	Returns the maximum, minimum, or middle value of parameters
	For example, mid(7,5,10) returns 7

flr x

	Returns the closest integer below x // x-(x%1) 
	flr(4.1)  --> 4
	flr(-2.3) --> -3.0


cos x
sin x

	Returns the cosine of x, where 1.0 indicates a full circle
	sin is inverted to suit screenspace
	e.g. sin(0.25) returns -1

	If you'd prefer radian-based trig functions without the y inversion, 
	paste the following snippet near the start of your program:
	
	cos1 = cos function cos(angle) return cos1(angle/(3.1415*2)) end
	sin1 = sin function sin(angle) return sin1(-angle/(3.1415*2)) end
	

atan2 dx dy

	Converts dx, dy into an angle from 0..1
	As with cos/sin, angle is taken to run anticlockwise in screenspace
	e.g. atan(1, -1) returns 0.125

sqrt x

	Return the square root of x
	
abs x

	Returns the absolute (positive) value of x

rnd x
	Returns a random number n, where 0 <= n < x
	If you want an integer, use flr(rnd(x))
	
srand x
	Sets the random number seed
	The seed is automatically randomized on cart startup

Bitwise operations

	band x y
	bor  x y
	bxor x y
	bnot x

	shl  x y
	shr  x y

	// shifts are logicial shifts (the sign bit is not shifted)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Custom Menu Items
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

menuitem index [label callback]

	Add an extra item to the pause menu
	
	Index should be 1..5 and determines the order each menu item is displayed
	label should be a string up to 16 characters long
	callback is a function called when the item is selected by the users
	
	When no label or function is supplied, the menu item is removed
	
	example:
	menuitem(1, "restart puzzle", function() reset_puzzle() sfx(10) end)
	

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Strings
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	s = "the quick brown fox"
	
	-- length
	
		print(#s)          --> 19
	
	
	-- joining strings
		
		print("three "..4) --> "three 4"
	
	
	-- sub() to grab substrings
	
		print(sub(s,5,9))  --> "quick"
		print(sub(s,5))  --> "quick brown fox"


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Cartridge Data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Each cartidge is able to store 64 numbers (256 bytes) of persistent data 
	on the user's PICO-8 (rather than on the cart itself). This can be used as
	a lightweight way to store things like high scores or to save player progress.
	
	If you need more than 256 bytes, it is also possible to write directly to the
	cartridge using cstore(). The disadvantage is that the data is tied to that
	particular version of the cartridge. e.g. if a game is updated, players will
	lose their savegames.
	
	Another alternative is to write directly to a second cartridge by specifying
	a fourth parameter to cstore(). This requires a cart swap though (so is 
	slightly slower), and leaves data-cart litter when run from a local folder.


cartdata id

	Call this once on cartridge load. id is a string up to 64 characters long, and 
	should be unusual enough that other cartridges do not accidentally use the
	same id.
	
	e.g. cartdata("zep_jelpi")
	
	legal characters are a..z, 0..9 and underscore (_)

	returns true iff data was loaded.

	cartdata can not be called more than once per cartridge execution.
	
	Once a cartdata id has been set, the area of memory 0x5e00..0x5eff is mapped 
	to permanent storage, and can either be accessed directly or via dget/dset.
	
	
dget index

	Get the number stored at index (0..63)
	Use this only after you have called cartdata()

dset index value

	Set the number stored at index (0..63)
	use this only after you have called cartdata()
	
	There is no need to flush written data -- it is automatically
	saved to permantent storage even if POKE()'ed directly.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	GPIO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	GPIO stands for "General Purpose Input Output", and allows machines to comunicate with 
	each other. PICO-8 maps bytes in the range 0x5f80..0x5fff to gpio pins that can be
	poke()ed (to output a value -- e.g. to make an LED light up) or peek()ed (e.g. to read
	the state of a switch).
	
	GPIO means different things for different host platforms:
	
	CHIP:         0x5f80..0x5f87 mapped to xio-p0..xio-p7
	Pocket CHIP:  0x5f82..0x5f87 mapped to GPIO1..GPIO6
		// xio-p0 & p1 are exposed inside the prototyping area inside the case.
	Raspberry Pi: 0x5f80..0x5f8f mapped to wiringPi pins 0..7
		// see http://wiringpi.com/pins/ for mappings on different models
	
	CHIP and Raspberry Pi values are all digital: 0 (LOW) and 255 (HIGH)
	
	Note that to have access to gpio pins, you may need to run pico8 as root: 
	
	sudo pico8
	
	A simple program to blink any LEDs attached on and off:
	
	t = 0
	function _draw()
	 cls(5)
	 for i=0,7 do
	  val = 0
	  if (t % 2 < 1) val = 255
	  poke(0x5f80 + i, val)
	  circfill(20+i*12,64,4,val/11)
	 end
	 t += 0.1
	end
	
	:: HTML
	
	Cartridges exported as HTML / .js use a global array of integers (pico8_gpio) to 
	represent gpio pins. The shell HTML should define the array:
	
	var pico8_gpio = Array(128);
