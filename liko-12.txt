	LIKO-12 is built with:
		LÖVE Framework: http://love2d.org/
==========================================================================================

Welcome to LIKO-12:
	LIKO-12 is a PICO-8 clone but with extra abilities, different API and bigger screen width.
	We are working on this because PICO-8 is not available under a free license that allows
	improvements and sharing, and also to lift some of the more restrictive limitations on games
	like the token limit.
	
	What's PICO-8 ??
	
	- PICO-8 is a fantasy console for making, sharing and playing tiny games and other computer 
	programs. When you turn it on, the machine greets you with a shell for typing in Lua programs 
	straight away and provides simple built-in tools for creating sprites, maps and sound.

	- LIKO-12 comes with a terminal, lua console, sprites editor and a code editor. It also comes
	with a modified pixel font which includes lower-case letters. We plan on adding a map editor and
	audio/music editor in the future.
	
	- So you can basically create spritesheets, and games using this console.

:: Bugs/Crashes reports

	Please report those at the github issues tracker:
	https://github.com/RamiLego4Game/LIKO-12/issues

:: Hello World
	
	After LIKO-12 boots, try loading the hello world builtin cart by typing those commands in the terminal:
		
		cd demos
		load helloworld
		run
	
	Try to to press and drag anywhere on the screen.
	
	To quit the cart press escape key, now to view the source code and sprites of the cart press escape key again.
	Now in the sprite editor try to edit the hello world sprite, then press escape to return to the terminal and type run.
	
	Awesome right?
	
	To save your cart type (you may replace myhelloworld with any name you like):
	
		save myhelloworld
		
:: Demo Carts
	
	Here's a list of the built-in demo carts the you can load, edit, run and save !
	
	cd demos
	
	tictactoe   A 2 players tictactoe game made by RamiLego4Game.
	helloworld  The helloworld example.
	noise       Fill the screen with random colors.
	
	To run a cart, open LIKO-12 terminal and type:
	cd demos
	load tictactoe
	run
	
	Press escape to stop the cart, and once more to enter editing mode.
	
	Delete the demos directory and restart liko12 to restore the defaults/ add new ones. "DEL demos"

:: Exporters / Importers
	
	To import or export the spritesheet as a .png:
	
		export spritesheet
		import spritesheet
		
:: Editing the internal spritessheet

	To edit the internal spritesheet type in the terminal:
	
		import editorsheet
	
	Edit the sheet as you like (You can edit the cursor too)
	
		export editorsheet
		reload

    Have fun hacking this :3

:: Auto saving

	LIKO-12 automatically saves your cart to /_backup.lk12 when typing shutdown/reload
	(_backup.lk12 is hidden in the dir/ls command, do "load _backup" to load it)
	
:: Terminal Commands

	COMMANDS <REQUIRED> [OPTIONAL]
	
	HELP: Shows help info
	NEW: Clears the memory
	RELOAD: Reloads the editorsheet
	RUN [args]: Runs the loaded cart
	SAVE <NAME>: Saves the current cart
	LOAD <NAME>: Loads a cart
	IMPORT <PATH>: Imports a spritesheet
	EXPORT <PATH>: Exports the current loaded spritesheet
	CLS: Clears the terminal
	VER: Shows LIKO-12 Title
	DIR/LS: Lists the directory items.
	CD: Change the working directory.
	DEL: Delete the give file/directory.
	MKDIR: Creates a directory at the given path.
	REBOOT: Reboots liko12 (And reloads all the internal code files).
	SHUTDOWN: Quit liko12.
	FOLDER: Opens the current directory with the host explorer.

:: Screen Rendering

LIKO-12 has non clearing canvas rendering system this means:
	- You don't have to redraw everything when resizeing the lk12 window
	- The screen doesn't clear every frame
	- You can draw to the screen anywhere in the code

	Note: everything called before _init() will be cleared.

:: Getting Started

To get started do the hello world tutorial then load and play demo games.

After that let's start:
	Type "load demos/helloworld" then type "run" to start it
	Go back to the editor (press esc twice) and switch to the code editor (The [] tab)
	From here you can start by reading the demo's code
	
How carts work:
	The game code gets excuted to overwrite the global callbacks
	Then the screen is cleared with black color
	After that the _init callback is called so the cart can draw
	Periodically the _update callback is called with delta time
	Finally whenever input happens the relevant callbacks are called so the game draws new content
 
SpriteSheet:
	Before running game code, the spritesheet is loaded to the globals so the game gets access to its spritesheet
 
So now read the demo games, and be sure to check the API documentation bellow.

Console Editor Tab:
	This is a work in progress feature, don't use it for now.
