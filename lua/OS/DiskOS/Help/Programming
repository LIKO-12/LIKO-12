To learn the Lua programming language visit \6http://lua-users.org/wiki/TutorialDirectory\7

To create games, press \6Escape/Back\7 to switch to the Editors Mode.
For a list of available API functions, check the official documentation webpage.

To edit system files, use \6"edit file.lua"\7. If you mess something up, you can always reinstall the OS from the BIOS.

Note that the system is overwritten whenever a new update comes, so it's better to create a folder in drive \BD\7 named \6"Programs"\7 and place your own programs there (you can override system programs).
