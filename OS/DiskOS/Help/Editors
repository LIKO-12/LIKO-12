\6As we mentioned earlier, \LIKO-12\7 has 5 editors,

Here I'll explain how useful they are, starting from the left-most slot, to the right-most slot:

\BCode editor:\7
In this editor you will write the \6code\7 of your game, using the \CLua\7 programming language, more about that later.

\BSprite editor:\7
In this editor you will draw the \6"Sprites"\7 of your game, using the limited \616 color palette\7, note that you can modified the palette colors in the game code.

\BMap editor:\7
In this editor you can edit your game map (if you need one), it uses the sprites edited in the \6Sprite editor\7 as tiles, the map is \6144x128\7 tile, and limited to the \9first 255\7 sprites, plus a special one \60\7 which is the \6eraser\7.

\BSFX editor:\7
In this editor you can edit the sound effects of your game, with \916\7 available slots. Which is powered by a \6chiptune generator\7 supporting \6square\7,\6pulse\7,\6sawtooth\7,\6triange\7 and \6noise\7 waveforms.

\BMusic editor:\7
This editor is \9work in program\7, and still doesn't exists...
