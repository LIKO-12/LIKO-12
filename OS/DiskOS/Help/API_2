\91.\7 Since the extra libraries are no longer available as globals, they are now loadable by calling `local lib = Library("library_name")`.

\92.\7 The `SpriteSheet` function is no longer a global, it's now a library, you can easily add it back by adding this line of code: `local SpriteSheet = Library("spritesheet")`

\93.\7 The old `input` function is now replaced with `TextUtils.textInput`, It's compatible with the old `input` function, But also has history and cursor movement support like in the terminal.
