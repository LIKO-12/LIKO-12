To learn the Lua programming language visit \6http://lua-users.org/wiki/TutorialDirectory\7

To create games, press \6Escape/Back\7 to switch to the Editors Mode.
For a list of available API functions, check the official documentation webpage.

To edit system files, use \6"edit file.lua"\7. If you mess something up, run \6factory_reset"\7 to revert the changes you've made.

Note that you will have to run \6"factory_reset"\7 whenever a new update comes, so it's better to create a folder in drive \BD\7 named \6"Programs"\7 and place your own programs there.
