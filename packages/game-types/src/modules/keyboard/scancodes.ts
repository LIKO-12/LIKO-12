/**
 * Keyboard scancodes.
 *
 * Scancodes are keyboard layout-independent, so the scancode "w" will be
 * generated if the key in the same place as the "w" key on an American QWERTY
 * keyboard is pressed, no matter what the key is labelled or what the user's
 * operating system settings are.
 *
 * Using scancodes, rather than keycodes, is useful because keyboards with layouts
 * differing from the US/UK layout(s) might have keys that generate 'unknown'
 * keycodes, but the scancodes will still be detected. This however would
 * necessitate having a list for each keyboard layout one would choose to support.
 *
 * One could use textinput or textedited instead, but those only give back the end
 * result of keys used, i.e. you can't get modifiers on their own from it, only
 * the final symbols that were generated.
