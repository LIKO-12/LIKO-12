## About:

---

LIKO-12 is an _open source_ **fantasy computer** completely written in the Lua programming language where you can make, play and share tiny retro-looking games and programs.

The LIKO-12 fantasy computer comes with a default, fully customizable, DOS-like operating system installed, called DiskOS, which provides an environment with basic command line programs and visual game editors.

Games are stored as disk files that can be saved, shared and uploaded to pastebin via the built-in program.
