This function is called everytime a key is pressed.

When the button is held for a little bit longer, this function will be called multiple times with `isrepeat` as true.

**Important Note:** Besure to call [controls("keyboard")](../DiskOS API/Controls.md) in the first line of the game !

**Another Note:** The keyboard on android can be closed by the user, so to reshow it you should call `textinput(true)` in [_touchpressed](./_touchpressed.md) callback.
