# Product Design Goals

This document contains the goals of the product design. Which is how LIKO-12 is made.

1. It's an educational program, that aims to get people into programming.
2. It would be suitable for creating games quickly in our free time.
3. Some arbitrary limitations are set by default so that the users don't overscale their games.

## Satisfying the goals

- The product should provide an abstracted, simplified API that's easy to use.
    - It's about removing the overhead of LÃ–VE and Lua's APIs.

## Miss-hits

(The factors that miss the actual goal of the product).

- Providing a pure Lua/JS environment is not the goal of the product.
- Providing an API that complies with the standard APIs of Lua/JS are not the goal of the product.
